## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file
- Ensure your database is running and accessible
- Check firewall settings if using a remote database

### Permission Issues
- Make sure the script has write permissions to the database
- Verify your database user has INSERT privileges

### Memory Issues
- For large datasets (>1000 records), consider running in batches
- Monitor your database connection pool settings

## Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Add new roles and skills in the `SKILL_SETS` dictionary
- Adjust the resume text templates in `RESUME_TEMPLATES`
- Change the email generation logic
- Modify the match score range
- Adjust the confirmation rate (currently 70%)

## After Seeding

Once the seed data is generated, you can:
1. Retrain your ML model: `python train_model.py`
2. Test the prediction API with the new data
3. Analyze the distribution of roles and skills in your database

## Cleanup

To remove all seeded data (use with caution):
```sql
DELETE FROM resumes WHERE user_email LIKE '%.gmail.com' OR user_email LIKE '%.yahoo.com' OR user_email LIKE '%.hotmail.com';
```
